Lab – While Loop 

Q1: Write a Python program to print the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 using a while loop.
Output:
Sum of even numbers = 2550

Q2: Write a Python program to reverse a number using a while loop.
Example:
Input: 1234
Output: 4321

Q3: Write a Python program to find the sum of digits of a given number using a while loop.
Example:
Input: 567
Output: 18 (5 + 6 + 7 = 18)

Q4: Write a Python program to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using a while loop.
Example:
Input: 36, 60
Output: 12

Q5: Write a Python program to calculate the power of a number using a while loop (without using the ** operator).
Example:
Input: base = 2, exponent = 4
Output: 16 (because 2^4 = 16)

Q6: Write a Python program to count the number of digits in a given number using a while loop.
Example:
Input: 78945
Output: 5

Q7: Write a Python program to check if a number is a palindrome using a while loop.
Example:
Input: 121
Output: "Palindrome"

Q8: Write a Python program to print all the prime numbers between 1 and 50 using a while loop.
Output:
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47

Q9: Write a Python program to find the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using a while loop.
Example:
Input: 12, 15
Output: 60

Q10: Write a Python program to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number using a while loop.
Example:
Input: 10
Output: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 (the Fibonacci sequence up to 10)
